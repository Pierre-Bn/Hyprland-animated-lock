This script is designed to run **mpv** while **hyprlock** or **swaylock** is active. It was originally intended to be used with converted Plymouth animations found [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/plymouth-themes) and converted with **convert.sh** found in utils.

### Installation and Usage

The main script, **Hyprlock-animated.sh**, is responsible for running **mpv** alongside **hyprlock/swaylock**. It points to an **output.webm** file generated by the **convert.sh** script located in the `utils` folder.

#### Customizing the Animation

To use your own animation, modify the path in **Hyprlock-animated.sh** to point to your desired video file.

### Hyprlock Configuration

For **Hyprlock-animated** to work properly, you **must** remove any background from your **hyprlock** configuration. A working file (**hyprlock.conf**) is provided in the `utils` folder if you don't feel like making it yourself. 

### Hyprland Configuration

Hyprland 0.50.0 added a security feature in commit [01971cb6c7b7607329314645bf46e83d985eafeb](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/pull/10865) disabling rendering of workspaces when the session is locked by default. 
**Hyprlock-animated** requires this change to be bypassed : this can be done by adding
```
misc = {
        session_lock_xray = true
}
```
to your **hyprland.conf** (not **hyprlock.conf**!) file.
